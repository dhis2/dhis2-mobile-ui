# DHIS2 Mobile UI

> **@dhis2/dhis2-mobile-ui** is
> a [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) DHIS2 design system
> library for [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) applications.

**DHIS2 Mobile UI library** is based in
the [DHIS2 Mobile Design System Figma library](https://www.figma.com/file/eRk6bt0B8BJlTO9PZXirHN/DHIS2-Mobile-Design-System).

This library currently supports **desktop** and **Android** targets, in the next versions it will
support **iOS** and **web**.

## Installation

In the module **build.gradle.kts**:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("org.hisp.dhis.mobile:designsystem:0.2")
}
```

# Usage

```kotlin
setContent {
  DHIS2Theme {
    // A surface container using the 'background' color from the theme
    Surface(
      modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
      color = SurfaceColor.Container
    ) {
      Components()
    }
  }
}
```

```kotlin
Button(
  text = provideStringResource("show_more"),
  icon = {
    Icon(
      painter = provideDHIS2Icon(resourceName = "dhis2_blood_a_n_positive"),
      contentDescription = ""
    )
  },
  style = ButtonStyle.KEYBOARDKEY
) {}
```

## Compose Compiler Reports

The Compose Compiler plugin can generate reports / metrics around certain compose-specific concepts
that can be useful to understand what is happening with some of your compose code at a fine-grained
level.
You can read more about
it [here](https://github.com/androidx/androidx/blob/androidx-main/compose/compiler/design/compiler-metrics.md).

To generate the reports / metrics, run the following Gradle command

```shell
./gradlew assembleDebug -PenableComposeCompilerReports=true
```

This would generate the output at `<module>/build/compose_metrics`

## Screenshot Testing

We are using [Paparazzi](https://cashapp.github.io/paparazzi/) for screenshot testing.

### Screenshot testing

```kotlin
class InputChipSnapshotTest {

  @get:Rule
  val paparazzi = paparazzi()

  @Test
  fun launchChip() {
    paparazzi.snapshot {
      ColumnComponentContainer {
        InputChip(label = "Label", selected = false, badge = "3")
        InputChip(label = "Label", selected = true, badge = "3")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Running tests

`./gradlew designsystem:testDebugUnitTest`

Runs tests and generates an HTML report at `/build/reports/paparazzi/` showing all test runs
and snapshots.

### Saving golden images to repo

`./gradlew designsystem:recordPaparazziDebug`

Saves snapshots as golden values to a predefined source-controlled location (defaults to
`/src/test/snapshots`).

### Verifying

`./gradlew designsystem:verifyPaparazziDebug`

Runs tests and verifies against previously-recorded golden values. Failures generate diffs at
`/build/paparazzi/failures`.

# Documentation

The Mobile UI documentation is integrated in the [developer portal](https://developers.dhis2.org/). It 
uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), a modern tool to build documentation pages.

The documentation is written in Markdown. The sidebar is automatically generated based on the metadata 
of the different files. It follows the rules explained in the [autogenerated sidebar docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/sidebar/autogenerated#autogenerated-sidebar-metadata). 
In short, every file must have a `sidebar_position` label at the beginning of the document, which 
defines the position of the document relative to its folder. Then, each folder has a `_category_.yml` 
file, which has a `position` property defining the position of that folder relative to its parent folder.

It is possible to nest as many folders as desired following that pattern.

## Testing

It is possible to build the Developers portal documentation to test your changes.

Steps to test:
1. Do the changes in the Mobile UI docs and push them to a branch in github.
2. Download the [Deverlopers portal repository](https://github.com/dhis2/developer-portal).
3. Change the branch in the Mobile UI block in the file `docs-migrate.js` to point to your branch.
4. Follow the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/dhis2/developer-portal/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
to build the docs.
